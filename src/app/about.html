                        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
                        <div class="text">
                            I was often bedevilled by distributed databases in my previous jobs as an infrastructure engineer. I just cannot find a database that is horizontally scalable and ensures distributed transactions at the same time. Later on, after discussions with the peers from other companies, I found that I am not alone and that this is a common issue that everybody is facing. So several of us sat down and took a serious look at this issue and decided to solve it once and for all - to develop a database of the future, hence PingCAP.
